# Data-Science-Assignment-Using-Python

This repostitory contains a Juptyer notebook based on a Data Science Predictive Analysis Assignement I undertook.

I was given some data (a training set and a test set) and a few instructions: I had to use the training set to produce precictions for the test set - the method I used was up to me but the goal was to minimise the Mean Squared Error of the predictions.
